I cleaned and extract the code of my blog to its own repo, now you can
install your own instance of [svbtle-jekyll](https://github.com/orlando/svbtle-jekyll) and [kudos_server](https://github.com/orlando/kudos_server) easily. Just follow the directions in the repo and you should be ready in 5 minutes (now you can deploy [kudos_server](https://github.com/orlando/kudos_server) to heroku).

Also I added a post generator to [svbtle-jekyll](https://github.com/orlando/svbtle-jekyll), and a separate configuration file (inside the `_data` folder) to make things cleaner and easier for everyone.

If you are having problem setting up the blog or just want to fix
something, create an issue or post your pull request.
